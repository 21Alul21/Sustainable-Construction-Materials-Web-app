This repository contains the code to a web application I built for my alx foundation project.

## **Aim of this project**
The aim of this project is to create a digital solution for the advancement and promotion of sustainable materials and good construction practice in the construction industry.

## **How does this web app work**
This application creates room for professional networking, where users get to see posts made by other professionals in the construction industry, these posts could be about breakthroughs from research about sustainable materials discovery and it could also be about best construction practices or even technical questions from users who seek help.

## **Future plans for this project**
This project right here is the MVP version, in the future, I intend to add AI functionalities, where the app can generate curated and specific response to searches, based on proven and trusted data. An AI model will be trained on quality data about sustainable materials, so, responses will be base off on the data.
